pny-trainings-ui-clone
This project is a UI clone of the PNY Trainings website, built using only core HTML and CSS â€” no frameworks or libraries.
The goal was to practice and improve frontend development skills by replicating a real-world 
academic/educational website layout with attention to design accuracy, responsiveness, and performance.
